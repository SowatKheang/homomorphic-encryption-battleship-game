## Homomorphic encryption Battleship game improvements

In this assignment, you need to implement a full Battleship board 10x10 matrix and each player has 5 boats with sizes of 5, 4, 3, 2 and 2 dots using homomorphic encryption to hide the board information. Also, instead of just Alice setting up a board and Bob guessing, you need to implement a version where they both have their own boards, and guess by taking turns, until there is a winner of the game.
